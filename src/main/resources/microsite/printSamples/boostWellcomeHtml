        <h4>Topping up, keys and cards</h4>
        We'll send you a new payment key for your electricity meter soon – and a payment card for your gas meter if your gas supply comes from us too. They'll arrive in the post no later than 2 days before you start getting your energy from us, but there are some important things to know first.

        <ol>
            <li><span>Start using your top-up key or card on your switch date, as it’ll be set and ready to go with your new Boost rates.</span></li>
            <li><span>As you start to get close to your Boost start date, avoid making any big top-ups with your old key and card, as you could lose this credit when you register your new ones.</span></li>
            <li><span>You can top up at any PayPoint. We'll include instructions with your new key and card on how to register them before topping up.</span></li>
            <li><span>If you have remaining credit when you register your key or card, you can contact your old supplier for a refund.</span></li>
            <li><span>If you already have a smart meter, we'll send you a different type of payment card and instructions on how to register it.</span></li>
